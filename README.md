# Time is NOT on Your Side! - Mitigating Timing Side Channels on the Web

On this page, you find the software and the data that I used for my talk at the
29th Chaos Communication Congress.

## The analysis software

In the [analysis-tool](/analysis-tool) folder you will find the analysis script
that I used for the measurements.

At the core of the analysis script is the library
[mona-timing-report](https://github.com/seecurity/mona-timing-report)
(previously known as [fau-timer](https://code.google.com/p/fau-timer/)).

Below you find the script that I used to measure the performance impact of
[Dan Kaminsky's tc timing mitigation proposal (slide 13)](http://dankaminsky.com/2012/08/06/bo2012/):
